# Cascadia- a light Atom syntax theme

A simple light theme reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest. This syntax theme showcases the greens, blues, browns, and greys of its forested coastline.



Also comes with other nice, aesthetic features like nice, standardized highlighting, and a beautiful find/replace flash.

![A beautiful example.](https://raw.github.com/KevinTheGuo/atom-theme-Cascadia/master/Cascadia.png)

Best used with Atom Material, with rgb(0, 90, 0) as primary color, and rgb(255, 255, 225) as secondary.
