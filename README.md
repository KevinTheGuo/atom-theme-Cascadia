# Cascadia- a light Atom syntax theme

A simple light theme reminiscent of the Pacific Northwest. This syntax theme showcases the greens, blues, browns, and greys of its forested coastline. All in a smooth, consistent, and eye-pleasing package.

For best results use alongside Atom Material, with rgb(0, 90, 0) as primary color, and rgb(255, 255, 225) as secondary.
